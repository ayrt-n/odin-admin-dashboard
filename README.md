# Odin Dashboard Recreation

## Overview

Final project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) as part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS section. 

Goal of the project was to recreate a landing page inspired by the provided [design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/html_css/grid-lessons/project-dashboard/dashboard-project.png).

Live version of the recreation can be viewed [here](https://ayrt-n.github.io/odin-admin-dashboard/).

## Initial Thoughts

Throughout second half of intermediate HTML and CSS section the focus has been on using CSS Grid. This project utilizes both CSS grid and flexbox to structure the layout of the full page and sub-elements, based on the task required.

Dashboard has been built to be responsive to a number of window sizes, however, it is not currently set up for mobile (not yet covered in curriculum).
